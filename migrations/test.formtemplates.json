Agati notes common examples, such as a\nfirstborn parent getting into “raging battles” with a firstborn child. “Both are used to getting\nthe last word. Each has to be right. But the parent has to be the grown-up and step out of\nthat battle,” he advises. When youngest children become parents, Agati cautions that\nbecause they “may not have had high expectations placed on them, they, in turn, may not\nsee their kids for their abilities.”\nBut he also notes that since youngest children tend to be more social, “youngest parents\ncan be helpful to their firstborn, who may have a harder time with social situations. These\nparents can help their eldest kids loosen up and not be so hard on themselves. Mom Susan\nRitz says her birth order didn’t seem to affect her parenting until the youngest of her three\nchildren, Julie, was born. Julie was nine years younger than Ritz’s oldest, Joshua, mirroring\nthe age difference between Susan and her own older brother. “I would see Joshua do to\nJulie what my brother did to me,” she says of the taunting and teasing by a much older\nsibling.\n“I had to try not to always take Julie’s side.” Biases can surface no matter what your own\nbirth position was, as Lori Silverstone points out. “As a middle myself, I can be harder on my\nolder daughter. I recall my older sister hitting me,” she says of her reactions to her\ndaughters’ tussles.\n“My husband is a firstborn. He’s always sticking up for the oldest. He feels bad for her that\nthe others came so fast. He helps me to see what that feels like, to have that attention and\nthen lose it.” Silverstone sees birth-order triggers as “an opportunity to heal parts of\nourselves. I’ve learned to teach my middle daughter to stand up for herself.\nMy mother didn’t teach me that. I’m conscious of giving my middle daughter tools so she\nhas a nice way to protect herself.”\n\nWhether or not you subscribe to theories that birth order can affect your child’s personality,\nultimately, “we all have free will,” Agati notes. It’s important for both parents and kids to\nrealize that, despite the characteristics often associated with birth order, “you’re not locked\ninto any role.",
